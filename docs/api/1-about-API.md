The Norwegian Public Roads Administration's Traffic Data API contains traffic data from public roads in Norway.
Traffic data is registered in traffic registration points from around the country on state and county roads, and some points are located on municipal roads.

All available data are on an aggregated level, where one hour is the shortest time interval.
Vehicle by vehicle data is not available to the public.

As of now, all data is for traffic volume.
The spatial resolution is per lane, direction or registration point, where each point is limited to one unique road reference.
The vehicles are classified according to their measured length.

All data has quality parameters associated with it, indicating their uncertainty and relevance.
All use of the data must take the quality parameters into account.
